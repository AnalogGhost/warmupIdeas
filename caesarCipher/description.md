#Caesar Cipher
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher (also known as a shift cipher) is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

Warm Up Activity.

1. Create a function that will take in plaintext and a shift number and return the encoded ciphertext.
2. Create a function that will take in the ciphertext a shift number and return plaintext.

Notes -

1.  Only letters should be shifted. All other laters should be ignored.


Warning - The Caesar cipher is ridiculously weak and easily broken.  This will provide virtually no security.
